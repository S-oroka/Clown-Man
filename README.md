## ***Description***
###  Welcome to Pangea, a game where you test your word country skills! This game has you guess the correct letters to discover the hidden country names. However, you only have a certain amount of guesses. If you don't guess the word in the amount of guesses given, you lose and Earth once again gets turned into Pangea!

## ***My Project's Journey*** ##
* To start, I created 2 empty HTML files, one for a cover and one for the actual game, a CSS file and a Javascript file.
* In my HTML files, I added boiler plates and set up a basic outline for what my pages would look like and addded buttons representing each letter in the alphabet.
* Next, in my JS file, I added some global variables to store inputs such as the guess count and chosen word and created an array of words I would choose.
* ...
## ***Checklist***
* [ ] Utilize flexbox or grid
* [ ] Include 2 HTML files with navigation between them
* [ ] Minimum 2 even handlers
* [ ] 20 meaningful git commits
* [ ] Properly indented and spaced, no commented out code
* [ ] Display proper use of global variables and function parameters
* [ ] Use camelCase for Javascript variables
* [ ] Be deployed on Surge
* [ ] Remove console.logs
